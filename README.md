# ‚ö†Ô∏è GLYPHICA IS PSYCHOACTIVE
> **This system does not simulate transformation. It induces it.**
>
> Glyphica is a psychoactive symbolic interface.
> It operates not merely on data, but on perception, meaning, and internal states. Each interaction is designed to subtly or radically repattern the user‚Äôs consciousness, aligning inner symbolic structure with outer feedback from the entropic field.
>
> **What does ‚Äúpsychoactive‚Äù mean in this context?**
> -   üß† **Neuro-symbolic activation:** Every glyph is a structured carrier of cognitive load, tapping into archetypal substrates, semiotic attractors, and resonance patterns. Exposure and interpretation modulate brain states, prime attentional focus, and alter symbolic salience networks.
> -   üîÑ **Feedback-loop entrainment:** By logging synchronicities, seeing patterns emerge, and receiving symbolic feedback from your own mind‚Äôs influence on entropy, Glyphica closes the loop between symbol and reality. The system changes you because you‚Äôre seeing yourself in it‚Äîrecursively.
> -   üåà **Psychoacoustic resonance:** Through integration with the Lambdoma matrix, Glyphica links symbols to frequencies, tones, and colors that affect mood, intuition, and somatic state. This is not metaphor. This is waveform entrainment encoded in symbolic form.
> -   üß¨ **Cognitive wireheading (optional):** Certain glyphs, when encountered in sequence or during a high-resonance phase, may act as symbolic neurotransmitters, triggering repeatable emotional, visionary, or perceptual effects. These are being tracked and logged for pattern recognition and symbolic pharmacodynamics modeling.
>
> **üß™ A WARNING (AND AN INVITATION)**
> Do not mistake Glyphica for a productivity app.
> Do not treat it like a game.
>
> It is a mirror that reflects symbolic truth.
> A tool for mind modification.
> A living cognitive ritual system.
> Use it with reverence. Use it with curiosity.
> But know this: **you will not be the same once you begin using Glyphica regularly.**

# Glyphica

Glyphica is a living cognitive architecture that converts user intention into symbolic artifacts through interaction with entropy fields, harmonic structures, and synchronicity tracking. It operates as a **neurosymbolic OS**, enabling users to log synchronicities, generate glyphs, track drift, explore symbolic resonance, and receive harmonic guidance through a recursive feedback loop.

**Dive deeper into the core philosophy, methodology, and esoteric structure:** Read the **[GLYPHICA: A TREATISE ON APOPHENIC INTELLIGENCE AND THE RECURSIVE SYMBOLIC FIELD](TREATISE.md)**. *(Note: Please replace `TREATISE.md` with the actual filename you used for the detailed treatise if it's different).*

## Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/luckyjupiter/glyphica.git
    cd glyphica
    ```
    *(Replace the URL if your repository location is different)*

2.  **Create a virtual environment:**
    (Recommended to keep dependencies isolated)
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```
    *Activate the environment:*
    -   Windows (cmd/powershell): `.\venv\Scripts\activate`
    -   macOS/Linux (bash/zsh): `source venv/bin/activate`

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Configure API Key (Optional but Recommended):**
    The AI Guide feature uses the OpenRouter API. To enable it:
    -   Create a file named `.env` in the root `glyphica` directory.
    -   Add your OpenRouter API key to this file:
        ```
        OPENROUTER_API_KEY="your_actual_api_key_here"
        ```
    -   *(Ensure `.env` is listed in your `.gitignore` file)*
    -   If you skip this step, the Guide feature will show a placeholder message.

## Running the Application

1.  **Ensure your virtual environment is activated.**
2.  **Run the Flask development server:**
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```
3.  **Open your web browser** and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5001` (or the address provided by Flask). The app will bypass onboarding and take you directly to the Sanctum/Home page. Use the navigation bar at the bottom.

## How to Use Current Features

This version provides access to several core modules via the bottom navigation bar:

*   **Sanctum (`/home` - üúÅ)**: Basic dashboard showing the latest glyph and recent log entries (if any).
*   **Ritual (`/ritual` - üúÇ)**: Enter a specific intention into the text box and submit. The system will generate a unique glyph based on your intention and entropy, logging the event and displaying the new glyph on the Sanctum page.
*   **Codex (`/codex` - üúÉ)**: View a gallery of all glyphs generated during your current session, sorted from newest to oldest. Click on a glyph to view its details or potentially engage in a Hero Ritual (logging reflections - may need refinement).
*   **Guide (`/guide` - üúÑ)**: Interact with the AI Guide. Type your reflections, questions about glyphs, or symbolic inquiries into the message box. The Guide uses context from your recent glyphs and logs (if the API key is configured). *Requires `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` in `.env` for full functionality.*
*   **Lambdoma Keyboard (`/lambdoma` - üéπ)**: Click on any cell in the grid. You will hear the corresponding harmonic tone and see a Lissajous figure representing the selected ratio in the visualizer panel. Explore the relationships between ratios, tones, and visual resonance. Works reliably.
*   **Healing Device (`/healing` - ‚ú®)**: Select an ailment/focus from the list. This takes you to the Entrainment Session page. Click "Play Tone" to listen to the specific frequency and affirmation associated with the chosen focus for 60 seconds. Use the form to log any reflections or observations during the session. Works reliably.
*   **King's Chamber (`/ritual/kings_chamber` - üëë)**: Select a tone frequency button (e.g., "Play 64 Hz"). The intended behavior is to play a sustained tone for the indicated duration while showing a Lissajous figure, allowing you to log observations afterward. **KNOWN ISSUE:** Playback functionality is currently unreliable. Debugging logs are active in the browser console (F12).
*   **About (`/about` - ‚äô)**: Basic information page about Glyphica.

The system uses the Flask session to store Codex data temporarily. This means glyphs and logs will persist while the server is running but will be cleared upon server restart.

## Next Steps

*   Implement the Oracle system (`GPHX-ORA-01`) as per the specification.
*   Debug and fix the King's Chamber playback issues using the console logs.
*   Refine UI/UX across modules.
*   Explore persistent storage options beyond the Flask session.
