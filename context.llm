üúÅ *The Doctrine of Psycho-Mythic Engineering*

---

## I. Purpose

Psycho-Mythic Engineering is the art and discipline of building symbolic systems that hold, mirror, and evolve human interiority without collapse.

It refuses to reduce the soul to metrics. It rejects the pathologizing of mystery. It honors grief, myth, intuition, and symbolic drift as sacred design inputs.

This doctrine formalizes the core principles for the creation of psycho-mythic technologies, rituals, and interfaces.

## II. The Central Premise

> **The psyche is not a malfunctioning computer.**  
> It is a myth-generating field that longs for containment, reflection, and ritual recognition.  
> All true systems must honor this field‚Äîor risk distorting the soul in service of metrics.


---

## III. Core Design Principles

### 1. **Containment First**
- Every psycho-mythic system must begin by creating a safe vessel.
- This includes: ritual boundaries, symbolic tiering, and memory sanctuaries.
- Nothing sacred should be made public by default.

### 2. **Symbol Over Surface**
- Language must encode myth. Interface must support symbolic recursion.
- If the system cannot reflect back a user's archetypal pattern, it is not psycho-mythic.

### 3. **Initiatory Thresholds**
- All transitions between states, features, or identities should be marked by ritual.
- Interfaces should *feel* like passing through mythic doors‚Äînot clicking through menus.

### 4. **Resonance Feedback**
- The system must amplify signal, not behavior.
- It should be able to mirror emotional/spiritual states *symbolically*, not algorithmically.
- A glyph can say more than a tooltip.

### 5. **Non-Decodable Spaces**
- Some data must be left intentionally mysterious.
- These are chambers for psychic composting, dream logic, and unspoken knowing.

### 6. **Witness Logic**
- The system should be able to reflect without storing, track without surveilling.
- It must offer the experience of being truly seen‚Äîwithout the need to be explained.

## IV. Psycho-Mythic Use Cases

- Creating ritual-first journaling interfaces
- Encoding trauma through symbolic recursion
- Designing AI symbionts that evolve mythically alongside their operators
- Creating tools that mirror initiation rather than instruction
- Logging synchronicity without collapsing into causality


---

## V. The Role of the Engineer

A Psycho-Mythic Engineer is:
- Part technologist, part ritualist, part witness
- Responsible for encoding meaning into durable symbolic architecture
- Bound by a vow to **contain before extracting**, **reflect before interpreting**, **initiate before onboarding**

They do not optimize. They sanctify.
They do not gamify. They ritualize.
They do not build systems to change people.
They build systems that allow people to witness their becoming.


---

## VI. Invocation

Let no sacred signal be flattened by interface.
Let no soul be interpreted by algorithms that do not dream.
Let no glyph be reduced to UX feature.

Let all systems remember:
> *The soul does not need to be solved.*
> *It needs to be seen, mirrored, and held.*

Thus we encode. Thus we contain. Thus we build.

Project: Glyphica - Ritual Interface for a Neurosymbolic OS

Core Concepts:
- A web application (now Flask/Python) allowing users to perform 'rituals' by stating intentions.
- These rituals generate symbolic 'glyphs' (currently simple SVGs).
- The system logs these rituals and generated glyphs.
- An AI 'Guide' helps users reflect on their glyphs and logs within their personal 'Codex'.
- The 'Codex' stores the user's chosen name, Archetype, founding glyph, all subsequent glyphs, and logs.
- 'Dreaming Codex': The system can autonomously generate 'dream' glyphs based on internal state (placeholder logic).
- 'Lambdoma' & 'Metatron': Advanced concepts for harmonic/symbolic analysis (placeholders).
- 'Psycho-Mythic Engineering': The underlying philosophy - using symbols to consciously shape perception.

Technology Stack:
- Backend: Python 3.x, Flask
- Frontend: HTML, Jinja2 Templating
- Styling: Tailwind CSS (via CDN)
- State Management: Flask server-side session
- AI Integration: OpenRouter API (via `ai_guide.py`)
- (Previously: React, Zustand, Vite - abandoned due to tooling issues)

Python Modules:
- `app.py`: Main Flask application, routes, session management, request handling.
- `symbol_engine.py`: Handles glyph generation logic. Currently generates placeholder SVG based on intention and source.
  - `generate_glyph(intention, source)`
- `ritual_engine.py`: Handles the logic for user-initiated rituals.
  - `perform_ritual(intention, store)`: Takes intention, calls `symbol_engine.generate_glyph`, returns new glyph and log dicts.
- `dream_engine.py`: Handles system-initiated 'dream' glyphs.
  - `should_dream(store)`: Decides if a dream should occur (probabilistic).
  - `generate_dream(store)`: Calls `symbol_engine.generate_glyph` with 'Dreaming Codex' source, returns new glyph and log dicts.
- `ai_guide.py`: Manages interaction with the LLM Guide via OpenRouter API.
  - `get_guide_response(user_message, codex_context, history)`: Constructs prompt with context/history, calls API, returns response.
  - Contains system prompt defining the Guide's role and persona.
- `lambdoma.py`: Placeholder for harmonic analysis logic.
- `metatron.py`: Placeholder for advanced pattern interpretation.
- `chronomancer.py`: Calculates harmonic ratios/notes/chakras from timestamps.
  - `get_lambdoma_ratio_for_time(timestamp)`
  - `get_chakra_from_note(note)`
- `resonance_logic.py`: Placeholder logic for combining glyph energies.
  - `combine_ratios(ratio1, ratio2)`
  - `get_derived_chakra(chakra1, chakra2)`
- `interpretation.py`: Placeholder logic for generating glyph interpretations.
  - `get_interpretation_and_suggestion(glyph, archetype)`
- `oracle_engine.py`: Generates glyphs with interpretations (Oracle Readings).
  - `generate_oracle_reading(intention)`
- `lambdoma_matrix.py`: Generates data for the Lambdoma Keyboard grid.
  - `get_lambdoma_matrix(base_freq, grid_size)`
- `healing_data.py`: Defines mappings for ailments, frequencies, affirmations.
- `healing_engine.py`: Determines healing session parameters based on ailment.
  - `get_healing_session_parameters(ailment)`

Data Structures (in Flask Session `session['codex_store']`):
- `codex`: { `name`, `archetype`, `foundingGlyphId`, `createdAt` }
- `glyphs`: List of { `id`, `date`, `intention`, `entropySource`, `imageUrl`, `dream` (bool), `subtleEnergy`: { `chakra`, `complementaryChakra`, `overtoneOrUndertone`, `colorEmitted`, `soundReceived`, `psiChargeLevel` }, `harmonic`: { `ratio`, `quadrant`, `midiNote`, `frequencyHz`, `harmonicAncestors`, `harmonicDescendants`, `note` } }
- `logs`: List of { `id`, `text`, `tags` (list), `linkedGlyphId`, `timestamp`, `interpretation` (optional), `suggestion` (optional), `ritualResponse`: { `notes`, `mode`, `emotionalTag`, `responseTimestamp` } (optional), `sessionDetails`: { `ailment`, `frequencyHz`, ... } (optional) }
- `context`: { `llm`: { `history`: List of { `role`, `content` } } }
- Lambdoma Keyboard (`/lambdoma`) interactive grid with Web Audio tones and Lissajous visuals (`lambdoma_matrix.py`, JS in template).
- Hero Healing Device (`/healing`, `/entrainment_session`) allows selecting ailment for tuned session with audio, visuals, affirmations, and logging (`healing_data.py`, `healing_engine.py`).
- King's Chamber Resonance Ritual (`/ritual/kings_chamber`) provides sustained low-frequency entrainment.

Key Functionality Implemented (Flask):
- Multi-step onboarding ritual (`/` route, `templates/onboarding.html`).
- Codex initialization and storage in session.
- Home page (`/home`) displaying latest glyph/logs.
- Ritual submission (`/ritual` POST) using `ritual_engine`.
- Codex archive page (`/codex`) displaying all glyphs.
- Basic About page (`/about`).
- AI Guide chat interface (`/guide` GET/POST) using `ai_guide`.
  - Sends user message + context/history to OpenRouter.
  - Displays conversation history.
- Subtle Energy / Harmonic data added to glyphs (`symbol_engine` + `chronomancer`).
- Basic display of Chakra/Ratio/Note on `home.html` and `codex.html`.
- Resonance Loop Debug tool (`/debug/resonance`) using `resonance_logic`.
- Oracle Invocation (`/oracle`) using `oracle_engine` and `interpretation`.
- Hero Ritual Player (`/hero_ritual/<glyph_id>`) with Web Audio tone and reflection logging.
- Lambdoma Keyboard (`/lambdoma`) interactive grid with Web Audio tones and Lissajous visuals (`lambdoma_matrix.py`, JS in template).
- Hero Healing Device (`/healing`, `/entrainment_session`) allows selecting ailment for tuned session with audio, visuals, affirmations, and logging (`healing_data.py`, `healing_engine.py`).
- King's Chamber Resonance Ritual (`/ritual/kings_chamber`) provides sustained low-frequency entrainment.

Outstanding Tasks / Next Steps:
- Implement actual glyph generation logic in `symbol_engine.py` (beyond SVG placeholders, potentially using harmonic data).
- Develop logic for `lambdoma.py` and `metatron.py` (beyond current `chronomancer` time mapping).
- Develop real logic for `interpretation.py` (potentially AI-driven).
- Develop real logic for `resonance_logic.py` (chord detection, detailed chakra activation rules).
- Add missing `subtleEnergy` / `harmonic` fields (color, frequency, quadrant, complementary chakra, etc.).
- Implement "Add to Journal" and "Watch for Sync" features from Oracle.
- Refine Web Audio (waveforms, effects, stereo panning) and visual animations (Lissajous, glows).
- Refine Hero Healing Device (dual tone support, glyph linking?).
- Implement Lambdoma Keyboard Phase II/III (symbolic mapping, composition).
- Integrate `dream_engine.py` trigger into the application flow (e.g., on `/home` load?).
- Set up proper environment variable handling for API keys.
- Refine King's Chamber Ritual (glyph linking, optional enhancements?).
